# Notes &mdash; Ruby on Rails Web Services and Integration with MongoDB

## Week 1 - Module 1

### MongoDB basics
* Import data: `mongoimport`

  Example: 

  ```
  mongoimport --db test --collection zips --drop --file path/to/zips.json
  ```

  What the above line is doing:

  import      | db name   | collection name | drop previous file | file to be imported
  :----------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------:|:--------------------------:
  mongoimport | --db test | --collection zips | --drop | --file path/to/<file>.json

  If mongo is not in the path environment variable, the above command must be run from absolute path to bin.

* Capped Collection

  Fixed-size collections that support high-throughput operations

  ```shell
  db.createCollection('log', { capped: true, size: 5242880, max: 5000 })
  # size is the size in bytes
  # max is the max number of documents allowed
  ```
  
  When collection fills allocated space, it makes room for new documents by overwriting oldest ones: first in, firt out.

  Logging is a good example for when to use a capped collection, also stock information. Collections in which historical data is not important. 

* Start mongo: `mongo`

* Switch to the **test** database: `use test`

### MongoDB Ruby Driver Setup
* mongo-ruby driver
  ```shell
  gem update --system
  gem install mongo
  gem install bson_ext
  ```

  On `irb`, it is necessary to `require mongo`

  Example

  ```shell
  require 'mongo'
  => true
  
  # connect 
  db = Mongo::Client.new('mongodb://localhost:27017')

  # which database to use
  db = db.use('test')

  db.database.name
  => "test"

  # which collection are available in the database
  db.database.collection_name
  => # list of collections (including zips)

  db[:zips].find.first
  => # return hash representation of the first object in zips collection

  # logger default is debug, change to INFO with:
  Mongo::Logger.logger.level = ::Logger::INFO
  ```

* Database (test), collection (zips), documents (each entry on zips collection &mdash; in this case, each city info)

#### Syntax
Most of the time, `{ key: value }` is OK for hashes with symbols as keys. However, the `=>` sign is necessary when using Mongo syntax (`:$lt`, `:"state.long_name"`)
