### Integrating MongoDB with RubyDriver

DAO (Data Access Object) class infrastructure (connection, database, collection). Use DAO class on Rails console to access collection.

This module: 

1. build a MVC example

2. **simulate a middleware ORM** consistent with Rails ActiveModel framework.

For the example:

1. Create new application: `rails new zips`

2. Add `mongoid` gem to Gemfile

3. Create `mongoid.yml` file: `rails g mongoid:config`

4. Edit `config/application.rb`, so when application starts, it connects to the database defined in `mongoid.yml`
  
  ```ruby
  # add to config/application.rb
  Mongoid.load!('./config/mongoid.yml')
  ```

5. Import data
  ```shell
  # import the zips.json file into the development db
  # (as define on the mongoid.yml file)
  # in a collection called zips
  mongoimport --db zips_developmet --collection zips --file path/to/zips.json
  ```

6. As `mongoid` is in use, connecting to the db will be different:
  ```shell
  mongo_client = Mongoid::Clients.default

  # the name of the db
  # as we are in the development mode, the db will be the dev db
  mongo_client.database.name
  => "zips_development"

  # set variable collection to the collection created with the imported JSON file
  collection = mongo_client[:zips]
  ```

#### Creating a DAO class infrastructure

  * Model class that connects to MongoDB and access the right collection.
  * Consistent with ORM operations

  DAO class will be `Zip class`, inside `model` directory

  ```ruby
  class Zip

    # access db client
    def self.mongo_client
      Mongoid::Clients.default
    end

    # access zips collection
    def self.collection
      self.mongo_client[:zips]
    end
  end
  ```

#### DAO Class - ORM Mapping

find | find(hash) | insert_one | update_one | delete_one
:---:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:
all  | find       | save       | update     | destroy

##### `all`

  Return all the documents from the collection

  `all` in the DAO class:

  ```ruby
  class Zip
  (...)

  def self.all(prototype={}, sort={population:1}, offset=0, limit=nil)
    # * prototype = a hash with a query criteria (hash will be passed to find)
    # * sort defaults to ascending population number if no argument is given
    # * offset (skip)
    # * limit (limit)

    # the following part of the method is used:
    # to map internal :population to :pop in the document
    # to symbolize keys
    # and to limit 'all' do search only by 'city' and 'state'

    # it takes the hash passed in as sort argument, loops through it
    # if sort has a key named :population
    # map it to :pop on the documents of the zips collection
    # for all other possible keys
    # check if key exists in the document
    # and if so, just keep it as it is, but turn it into a symbol
    tmp = {}
    sort.each do |key, value|
      key = key.to_sym == :population ? :pop : k.to_sym
      tmp[key] = value if [:city, :state, :pop].include?(key)
    end
    sort = tmp

    # convert to keys and then eliminate any properties not of interest
    # symbolize_keys is a Rails method
    prototype = prototype.symbolize_keys.slice(:city, :state) unless prototype.nil?

    # here is where the find done
    result = .collection.find(prototype)
             .projection(city: true, state: true)
             .sort(sort)
             .skip(offset)

    result = result.limit(limit) unless limit.nil?
  end

  (...)
  end
  ```

  Example:

  ```shell
  Zip.all({ city: 'PORTLAND' }, { population: 1 }, 0, 2).to_a
  => [{"_id"=>"65067", "city"=>"PORTLAND", "state"=>"MO"}, 
      {"_id"=>"71663", "city"=>"PORTLAND", "state"=>"AR"}]
  ```
